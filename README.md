# DFS_BFS

# depth first search vs breadth first search


Given a source string and a destination string write a program to display sequence of strings to travel from source to destination. Rules for traversing:
* You can only change one character at a time
* Any resulting word has to be a valid word from dictionary

Example: Given source word CAT and destination word DOG , one of the valid sequence would be

```
CAT -> COT -> DOT -> DOG
```

Another valid sequence can be
```
CAT -> COT - > COG -> DOG
```

One character can change at one time and every resulting word has be a valid word from dictionary
